question,answer
Where and when will users see the landing page?,"The landing page will be displayed across all site versions (Canada (EN, FR), US, UK,  SP) of our workhealthlife.com site. Users will see the landing page when they access the site  from various urls, including for example: workhealthlife.com, travailsantevie.com,  workhealthlife.com/us, and workhealthlife.com/MyEAP.   On the landing page, users will have four options to enter the site:   1) New users can register for an account  2) Returning users can login using their existing, unique credentials; this is called a hard  login  3) New or returning users can identify their organization; this is called a soft login  4) New or returning users can browse as guest   The landing page and soft login option will go live on Tuesday September 26, 2017."
What is a hard vs. soft login?,"Hard login refers to a user entering their unique credentials to enter the site. On  our site, it is username (email address) and unique password. Soft login refers to the user  entering their organization name to enter the site and does not require unique user  credentials to enter the site. A soft login will allow the user to see the specific instance of  workhealthlife.com that is set up for that organization."
What if a user is in crisis?,Anyone in crisis should call 911 or the CAC. The CAC phone number will be  displayed on the landing page and throughout workhealthlife.com.
"If a user enters the site with soft login, what will they see and have access to?","Users that soft login will enjoy a very similar experience to that of a hard login.  When applicable, they will see their organization’s contracted services and tools available,  company logos, dedicated EFAP phone numbers, and any other configurations that are specific to their organization, including the online tools buttons (Online Access, First Chat,  and E-Counselling) displayed (or not) in the right rail area.   If they wish to use their active Online Programs under My Activity or view the Manager  Area, they must complete a hard login.   When applicable, if they wish to use the online tools (First Chat or Online Access), they can  click and start to use – there is no hard login required – as the individual’s information is  collected once inside the tools.   If they wish to use E-Counselling, they will be redirected to the E-Counselling Portal and use  their E-Counselling credentials to login there. Please note: A case for E-Counselling must first  be booked via the EFAP before a user can participate in the program."
Why are we implementing a landing page and soft login option?,"We’ve been listening to your feedback; the new landing page and soft login option  will make it easier and faster for users to see the details of the EFAP that is offered to them  and their family, including specific services available and any dedicated EFAP phone  numbers."
Will a user see our dedicated EFAP phone number on the landing page?,"No. A user needs to either register or enter the site with a hard or soft login to see  any customizations for your organization, including dedicated EFAP phone numbers. If they  select guest view, they will not see any customizations."
What if my organization has a custom workhealthlife.com url?,"If you usually access the EAP website through a custom url (e.g.  workhealthlife.com/Orgnamehere), you will skip the landing page as your organization is  already identified in the url. Same as today, you will be taken straight to your specific  instance of the site."
Will there be any changes to the urls that I use today?,"No. All urls used today, and found on promotional materials, social media, client  intranet sites, etc… will remain the same. Users will simply encounter the landing page  when they arrive on the site beginning September 26, 2017."
Are there changes to the registration or hard login process end-users know,today?    No. The existing account registration and hard login process (entering a username  and unique password to access the site) remains the same as today. Users will not have to  re-register or create new hard login credentials. The soft login option will now allow users to  gain site entry by simply identifying their organization.
Is there a browse as guest option?,"Yes. If a user chooses not to register, login (hard or soft), they can browse as a  guest."
What if I have additional questions?,Please send along any questions to your HR Representative or call the EFAP.
